# EasyPark
An Automatic Number Plate Recognition System to solve the problem of parking system in UKM Residential Colleges

#### The Parking System Problem
UKM Residential College specifically the 12th College (Kolej Pendeta Za'ba), have gone through years of parking system problem. The exisitng system uses RFID, where each registered vehicle is given an RFID tag. Problem arises as students tend to share the RFID tag, allowing unregistered vehicle to have access to the parking space illegally. This then causes stolen parking spot, misuse of parking space and many more.

To solve this problem, a solution is made to make sure only register vehicle will get access to the parking space.

#### The solution
EasyPark is an automatic number plate recognition system. The system works by detecting the number plate of the vehicle, if the number plate is registered in the system, the gate will be opened.
